<h2>What I'm doing while I'm studying Web Development.</h2>
<br>
<h2>Welcome</h2>
This repository is about basic projects, examples and exercises done at <strong>IES Mar√≠a de Zayas y Sotomayor</strong>, Madrid (Spain).
Keep in mind that some things at this repository should be a repository on its own but I preferred to keep everything in the same place.

The most important things done at first year were a project for Markup languages subject, you can check it <a href="https://github.com/wickedmelkor/wickedmelkor.github.io"><strong>HERE</strong></a>, and a Continious Integration project (Maven + Jenkings + git + Java) that you can check <a href="https://github.com/bulbrange/TOD2"><strong>HERE</strong></a>.
